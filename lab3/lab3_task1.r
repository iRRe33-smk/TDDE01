### TASK 1, SUM OF THREE GAUSSIAN KERNELS ###



### TASK 2, PRODUCT OF THREE GAUSSIAN KERNELS ###


### Our Gaussian kernel ###

### hourDist ###
hourDist <- function(h1,h2){
    # Computes the relative distance between hours
    # over a day Using sine-function for this is
    # ideal, given its periodicity and that it rewards
    # timestamps closer to the original. Kernel is symmetric so
    # sign doesnt matter.

### dateDist ###
dateDist <- function(h1,h2){
    # Computes the relative distance between days
    # over a year. Using sine-function for this is
    # ideal (value ranges from 0 to 1), given its periodicity 
    # and that it rewards days closer to the original.
